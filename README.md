# The ETCBC Syriac Corpus

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/1038557390.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16966128)

This is the Text-Fabric dataset of the ETCBC database of Syriac literature. It is the result of a collaboration of the [**ETCBC**](https://etcbc.nl) and the [**CACCHT**](https://github.com/CACCHT) project (Creating Annotated Corpora of Classical Hebrew Texts).

## Texts
The dataset is based on the following texts:
- Peshitta: Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Judges, 1 and 2 Kings, Jonah, Psalms 1-30, Sirach.
- Syrohexapla: Psalms 1–32
- The Book of the Laws of the Countries
- Oratio Manasseh, Prayer of Manasseh (versions A and B)
- Epistle of Baruch (versions A and B)
- Ephrem, Ephrem’s Sermon on the Ninevites

## Features
All the text features are based on the ETCBC transcription. We will add text features in Syriac script (Estrangela) soon.
The dataset will be expanded with new texts and new features in the course of the following years.

The dataset contains word level features and is work in progress.
