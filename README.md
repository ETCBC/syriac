[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.16966129.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16966129)

This is the Text-Fabric dataset of the ETCBC database of Syriac literature. It is the result of a collaboration of the [**ETCBC**](https://etcbc.nl) and the [**CACCHT**](https://github.com/CACCHT) project (Creating Annotated Corpora of Classical Hebrew Texts).

## Texts
Version 0.4 of the dataset is based on the following texts:
- Peshitta: Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, 1 and 2 Kings, Jonah, Psalms 1-30, Daniel, Sirach.
- Syrohexapla: Psalms 1–32
- Bardaisan, The Book of the Laws of the Countries
- Oratio Manasseh, Prayer of Manasseh (versions A and B)
- Epistle of Baruch (versions A and B)
- Ephrem's Prose Refutation against Mani
- Ephrem’s Sermon on the Ninevites
- Pseudo-Methodius
- The Apocalypse of Pseudo-Ezra

## Features
All the text features are based on the ETCBC transcription. The dataset contains a representation of the consonantal text in Estrangela script as well (feature g_cons_utf8).
The dataset will be expanded with new texts and new features in the course of the following years.

The dataset contains word level features and is work in progress.

The texts are based on the following editions, we thank the editors for their permission to use them in our dataset.

- For the Peshitta, the text is taken from [Vetus Testamentum Syriace](https://brill.com/display/serial/PES) prepared by the Peshitta Institute Amsterdam (formerly Leiden), also electronically integrated in the [Brill Scholarly editions](https://scholarlyeditions.brill.com/peso/). Our text does not include the critical apparatus. The text of Ben Sira is a preliminary version. The official edition is in preparation.
- The Book of the Laws of the Countries was prepared by Dirk Bakker on the basis of [Drijvers' edition](https://archive.org/details/bookoflawsofcoun0000bard/) as part of his [PhD project](https://scholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl/handle/1887/17580) (2006–2010).
- The text of the sermon of Ephrem the Syrian on Nineveh and Jonah was prepared by Constantijn Sikkel and Geert-Jan Veldman. It is based on the running text in Des heiligen Ephraem des Syrers Sermones II (Corpus scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium 311 = Scriptores Syri 134), with application of Beck's emendations introduced by "Lege", "Corrige", or "Omitte", provided that they are based on a manuscript.
- The text of Pseudo-Methodius is based on the edition by Reinink (Corpus scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium).
- We used a slightly corrected version of the text of The Apocalypse of Pseudo-Ezra that was prepared by Laura Locke Estes for her [MA Thesis](https://digitalcommons.acu.edu/etd/41/).
