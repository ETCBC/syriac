This is the Text-Fabric dataset of the ETCBC database of Syriac literature. It is the result of a collaboration of the [**ETCBC**](https://etcbc.nl) and the [**CACCHT**](https://github.com/CACCHT) project (Creating Annotated Corpora of Classical Hebrew Texts).

## Texts
Version 0.4 of the dataset is based on the following texts:
- Peshitta: Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, 1 and 2 Kings, Jonah, Psalms 1-30, Daniel, Sirach.
- Syrohexapla: Psalms 1–32
- The Book of the Laws of the Countries
- Oratio Manasseh, Prayer of Manasseh (versions A and B)
- Epistle of Baruch (versions A and B)
- Ephrem, Ephrem’s Sermon on the Ninevites
- Pseudo-Methodius
- The Apocalypse of Pseudo-Ezra

## Features
All the text features are based on the ETCBC transcription. The dataset contains a representation of the consonantal text in Estrangela script as well (feature g_cons_utf8).
The dataset will be expanded with new texts and new features in the course of the following years.

The dataset contains word level features and is work in progress.
