# syriac
This is the Text-Fabric dataset of the ETCBC database of Syriac literature. It is the result of a collaboration of the ETCBC and the CACCHT project (Creating Annotated Corpora of Classical Hebrew Texts).

The dataset contains the following texts:
Peshitta: Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Judges, 1 and 2 Kings, Jonah, Psalms 1-30
PsH
Sirach
The Book of the Laws of the Countries
OrManA
OrManB
Eprx
ESNJ

All the text features are based on the ETCBC transcription. We will add text features in Syriac script (Estrangela) soon.
The dataset will be expanded with new texts and new features in the course of the following years.

The dataset contains word level features and is work in progress.
